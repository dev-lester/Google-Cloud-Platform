        <p>
            I'm Lester Sales. I live in Quezon City, PH with my father, sister and my crappy computer. <br>
            I call myself as a software developer and I mostly code in JavaScript because I don't know I just <br>
            love it even though I haven't started a job in software development since I graduated in college. <br>

            Why do you blog?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Mostly for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of software development over time – <br> 
            whatever I am thinking about or working on. I research things I find interesting, then document my <br>
            research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people <br>
            will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. I firmly believe that blogs are a two way <br> 
            conversation, so I welcome email and comments – as long as they're on topic, more or less.<br>
